  "description": "For a deeper understanding of the lifecycle of an Aptos transaction (from an operational perspective), we will follow a transaction on its journey, from being submitted to an Aptos fullnode, to being committed to the Aptos blockchain. We will then focus on the logical components of Aptos nodes and take a look at how the transaction interacts with these components.",
